# Exercises

Lab’s goal is to put in a rep doing everything that you did during the [Express Routers & Controllers](https://www.notion.so/Express-Routers-Controllers-d1d13d2ef3fc4b77b42e00e0821ce4ad) lesson:

- Scaffold a new app named `express-dev-skills` using `e-gen-replacement` (don’t forget to run `npm i`).
- Be sure to create an array of “fake” data representing some of your awesome developer skills. The specific properties describing a skill object is up to you!
- Implement **index** functionality for the `skills` resource
- Implement **show** functionality for the `skills` resource

## Hints

- Keep the data resource name short and simple - something like `skills`.
- Following best-practice routing and MVC will result in the following modules for the `skills` resource:
    - **`routes/skills.js`**
    - **`data/skill-db.js`**
    - **`views/skills`**
    - **`controllers/skills.js`**
- Use [RESTful/Resourceful Routing Conventions](https://www.notion.so/RESTful-Resourceful-Routing-Conventions-6ea1354646bf42c7a7471769981a57cc)

# Bonuses

- Use EJS partial views to make your templates more DRY (see link in the Reference section of the lesson) or [**this link**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs#includes).
- Add styling or use a CSS framework to make the app look better
